## Setting up an UnifiedPush Server instance

Before building and deploying the clients it's necessary to set up an _UnifiedPush Server_ instance. There are actually 3 options for doing this :

* Using the OpenShift [AeroGear Cartridge](https://aerogear.org/docs/unifiedpush/ups_userguide/index/#openshift) . This is the easiest option, if you don't have an OpenShift account yet, you can freely sign up [here](https://www.openshift.com/app/account/new).
* Download the released WARs, you can grab them [here](https://aerogear.org/getstarted/downloads/#push) and then follow [these instructions](https://aerogear.org/docs/unifiedpush/ups_userguide/index/#server-installation) to set up the database and to deploy it on an Application Server.
* Build from the source : clone this [repo](https://github.com/aerogear/aerogear-unifiedpush-server) and then follow [these instructions](https://aerogear.org/docs/unifiedpush/ups_userguide/index/#server-installation) to set up the database and to deploy it on an Application Server.


## Creating an Application and the Variants

Once the UnifiedPush Server has been deployed, you will need to create an Application. Please refer to the [UnifiedPush Administration Console User Guide](https://aerogear.org/docs/unifiedpush/ups_userguide/index/#admin-ui).

Before creating the variants, some external setup on Google's Cloud console and/or Apple's Developer Portal is needed.

* For Android you can follow [these instructions](https://aerogear.org/docs/unifiedpush/aerogear-push-android/guides/#google-setup)
* For iOS you can follow [these instructions](https://aerogear.org/docs/unifiedpush/aerogear-push-ios/guides/#app-id-ssl-certificate-apns)


Finally, you will have to create your variants, instructions can be found in the [UnifiedPush Administration Console User Guide](https://aerogear.org/docs/unifiedpush/ups_userguide/index/#_wizard_step_2)
